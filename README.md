## ECZ Remote Help

At EasyComp Zeeland, we noticed that existing tools such as AnyDesk and TeamViewer are often insufficient: slow, expensive and not always compatible with macOS, Linux and Windows. That's why we developed the **ECZ QHOATOOL (Quick Help Remote Tool)**: a fast and secure solution that allows our experts to help immediately without delay or restrictions. In addition, we offer the **ECZ HOATOOL (Remote Help Tool)** to the public, so that everyone—family, friends or colleagues—can immediately offer and receive help from each other. The tools are fully compatible, user-friendly and freely accessible, so you can quickly find the right support and solve problems yourself.

Discover how you can find help yourself and get immediate support via:
