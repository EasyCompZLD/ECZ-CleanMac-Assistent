## Overview

Upon launching **CleanMac Assistant**, you are presented with a welcome dialog that emphasizes the initiative‚Äôs mission: offering powerful maintenance utilities free of charge. The script credits open-source projects‚Äîincluding Homebrew, ClamAV, and ncdu‚Äîand directs users to EasyComp Zeeland‚Äôs website for more information. It also highlights ECZ‚Äôs remote assistance services for anyone who needs additional help.

Before running any cleanup or maintenance routines, CleanMac Assistant automatically checks that essential dependencies (ClamAV, ncdu, and Homebrew) are installed. If any of those components are missing, the script installs them via Homebrew, displaying a macOS notification each time. This ensures that every feature‚Äîranging from malware scanning to disk usage analysis‚Äîcan execute without interruption.

---

## Dependencies

CleanMac Assistant relies on three key command-line tools:

1. **Homebrew**  
2. **ClamAV** (for malware scanning)  
3. **ncdu** (for interactive disk usage analysis)  

At the start of execution, the script runs `checkDependencies()`. If any dependency is absent, it invokes Homebrew to install the missing utility:

```applescript
on checkDependencies()
    set dependencies to {"clamav", "ncdu", "brew"}
    repeat with i from 1 to count of dependencies
        set dependency to item i of dependencies
        try
            do shell script "which " & dependency
        on error
            display notification "Installing " & dependency & "..." with title "CleanMac Assistant"
            do shell script "/usr/local/bin/brew install " & dependency
        end try
    end repeat
end checkDependencies
````

## Script Structure & Functions

Below is a high-level breakdown of each function in the AppleScript, with English names and descriptions.

### 1. Dependency Check

* **`checkDependencies()`**
  Verifies presence of `clamav`, `ncdu`, and `brew`. If any is missing, installs it via Homebrew and displays a notification.

### 2. Human-Readable Task Names

* **`humanNameFor(taskID)`**
  Converts an internal task identifier (e.g., `"trash"`) into a human-readable English string (e.g., `"Empty Trash"`). This is used when showing dialogs and notifications.

  ```applescript
  on humanNameFor(taak)
      if taak is "trash" then
          return "Empty Trash"
      else if taak is "checkDependencies" then
          return "Check Dependencies"

          return "Clean Chrome Cache"
      else if taak is "firefox" then
          return "Clean Firefox Cache"
      else if taak is "ram" then
          return "Free RAM"
      else if taak is "scripts" then
          return "Run Maintenance Scripts"
      else if taak is "dns" then
          return "Flush DNS Cache"
      else if taak is "restart" then
          return "Restart Finder & Flush"
      else if taak is "update" then
          return "Install macOS Updates"
      else if taak is "brew" then
          return "Update Homebrew Packages"
      else if taak is "safari" then
          return "Clear Safari History"
      else if taak is "imessage" then
          return "Delete iMessage Logs"
      else if taak is "cookies" then
          return "Delete Browser Cookies"
      else if taak is "facetime" then
          return "Delete FaceTime Logs"
      else if taak is "malware" then
          return "Perform Malware Scan"
      else if taak is "agents" then
          return "Remove LaunchAgents"
      else if taak is "uninstall" then
          return "Uninstall Application"

   * **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for providing or receiving remote assistance.
   * **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Both tools are available for download, along with step-by-step instructions and FAQs, at:

[https://easycompzeeland.nl/services/hulp-op-afstand/](https://easycompzeeland.nl/services/hulp-op-afstand/)

Whether you need direct assistance from an EasyComp Zeeland expert or want to help someone remotely, **ECZ Remote Help** has you covered.
